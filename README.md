### This repo contains three jQuery exercises that do the following:

1. Show and hide a nav-bar. (Used .fadeIn(), .fadeOut(), and .html()).  

2. Add text input into a list. (Stored input in a var and used .append() to create and add a new li element).

3. Add text input and a delete button into a list. Each list item can be
   deleted individually. (Event delegation was used so that any li element in the wrapper will be removed if clicked).
